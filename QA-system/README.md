# Question and answer system
The Question and Answer System is a system that combines LangChain and Large Language Models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3, and uses React/TypeScript for the frontend and Python FastAPI for the backend. Qdrant is used to store embeddings and text documents for fast search.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/conect2ai/carbot-manual-compare.git
```

2. Create an account on [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/) to get your`API_KEY` and `HOST_URL`.

3. Create an account on [OpenAi API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). ou will need OpenAI credits to run the application, and in general, new users get $5 credits to test the API. This is enough to run the application.

4. Create an API key in the OpenAI API. To do this, click on the `View API keys` option and create a new API key. Copy the `OPENAI_API_KEY` value from the key that was created.

5. Go to `/backend/app` and create a `.env` file with the following structure, replacing `<YOUR_KEY>` with your key:
```
QDRANT_HOST="<YOUR_KEY>"
QDRANT_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY>"
OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY>"
```

6. Still at `/backend/app`, create a virtual environment, and execute the following commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

7. In other terminal, go to `/frontend` and execute the following commands to run the frontend:
```
npm install
npm start
```

With this, the application will run and can be accessed at `localhost:3000`
